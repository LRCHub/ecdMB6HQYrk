She's my best friend
Certainly not your average girl
Yeah, she's my best friend
She understands me when I'm feeling -

- Down-down-down-down-down-down
You know it sure hurts to be that way
Down-down-down-down-down-down
You know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella

Ah, here's to Mullberry Jane (here's to Mullberry Jane)
She made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet
Now, jelly rolls in the street

If you want to see me
Well, honey, you know that I'm not around
But if you want to hear me
Why don't you just turn around
And by the window where the light is

She's my best friend
Certainly not just like your average dog or car
She's my best friend
She understands me when I'm feeling -

- Down-down-down-down-down-down
You know it sure hurts to be that way
Down-down-down-down-down-down
You know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella

Let's hear one for Newspaper Joe (Newspaper Joe)
He caught his hand in the door (caught his hand in the door)
Dropped his, ah, teeth on the floor, they say
Hey, now, joke is that's the way the news goes

If you want to see, yeah, see me
Well, baby, you know that I'm not around
But if you want to feel, yeah, feel me
Why don't you just turn around
And by the window where the light is

She's my best friend
She's my best friend, tell me, oh, baby now
She's my best friend
Oh, she's my, she's my best friend, give it now
She's my best friend
She's my, she's, she's my best friend
She's my best friend
She's my best friend, tell me, oh, babe now
